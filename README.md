## Examples

### Simple Example
In this simple example, we demonstrate how to create a basic prompt that allows users to choose their area of interest and receive content based on their selection.

```toml
[prompt.features.personalization.domains]
Description = "Choose your area of interest."
Domain_A = "Science"
Domain_B = "History"

[prompt.commands.commands]
Description = "Available commands."
help = "Get help."
choose_domain = "Choose your area of interest."
```

### Advanced Example
In this advanced example, we demonstrate how to create a more complex prompt that includes additional personalization options, such as content complexity and interaction styles.

```toml
[prompt.features.personalization]
Description = "Personalized settings."

[prompt.features.personalization.domains]
Description = "Choose your area of interest."
Domain_A = "Science"
Domain_B = "History"

[prompt.features.personalization.complexity]
description = "Choose content complexity level."
Level_1 = "Basic"
Level_10 = "Advanced"

[prompt.features.personalization.interaction_styles]
Description = "Choose interaction style."
Style_A = "Text-based"
Style_B = "Voice-based"

[prompt.commands.commands]
Description = "Available commands."
help = "Get help."
choose_domain = "Choose your area of interest."
choose_complexity = "Choose content complexity level."
choose_interaction = "Choose interaction style."
```
